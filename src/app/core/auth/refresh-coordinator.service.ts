/**
 * Single-flight guard around `POST /api/bff/auth/refresh` (WEB-9 reliability hardening). Two
 * independent callers can both want a refresh at once — `auth.interceptor.ts` reacting to a 401,
 * and `AccessTokenRefreshSchedulerService` refreshing proactively ahead of expiry — and it's
 * common for several *requests* in the same tab to 401 at (near) the same moment right after the
 * access token expires (e.g. a product page firing several widget calls together). Without
 * coalescing, each would issue its own refresh call. The BFF itself also coalesces server-side
 * (`routes.ts`, both an in-process guard and a cross-instance Redis lock) to stay correct across
 * pods and tabs regardless of what the client does, but closing the race here too avoids
 * redundant round trips in the common single-tab case — meaningful at this app's traffic volume.
 *
 * `shareReplay(1)` lets every caller that arrives while a refresh is in flight subscribe to the
 * same underlying HTTP call (and replays its outcome, success or error); `finalize` drops the
 * cached observable once that call settles so the *next* trigger starts a fresh refresh rather
 * than replaying a stale one.
 *
 * The resulting `SessionInfo` is also applied to `AuthService.session` here — a refresh rotates
 * `accessTokenExpiresAt` (and possibly `roles`), so every consumer of the session signal (the
 * proactive-refresh scheduler itself included) sees the up-to-date session immediately rather
 * than only after the next explicit `loadSession()`.
